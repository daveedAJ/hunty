# Hunty

> A cross-platform scavenger-hunt platform and dApp combining web, mobile, and on-chain rewards.

**Hunty** is an evolving project that helps creators publish location-based hunts and gives players NFT, token, and other on-chain rewards for completing challenges. It combines a Next.js web frontend, an Expo-based mobile app, IPFS-hosted content, and integrations with the Stellar/Soroban ecosystem for payments, NFTs and smart-contract logic.

**Highlights**

- **Multi-platform:** Web (Next.js App Router) + React Native (mobile/) for parity across devices.
- **On‑chain rewards:** Smart‑contract integrations with Stellar/Soroban, wallet adapters (Freighter) and NFT support.
- **Decentralized assets:** IPFS used for storing media and metadata for hunts and NFTs.
- **Developer tooling:** Unit tests with Vitest, E2E tests with Playwright, type-safe code in TypeScript.

**Key Features**

- Create, publish and manage hunts (creator dashboard).
- Play hunts via a guided UI with location/clue validation and progress tracking.
- Mint and claim NFT rewards and on-chain tokens for completed hunts.
- Community and leaderboard components for social play.

**Tech Stack**

- Frontend: Next.js (app/), React, TypeScript
- Mobile: Expo / React Native (mobile/)
- Storage: IPFS for media and metadata
- Blockchain: Stellar + Soroban smart contracts, wallet adapters, transaction helpers
- Testing & CI: Vitest (unit), Playwright (E2E)
- Tooling: pnpm, Tailwind/postcss (where applicable), Playwright, Vitest

**Repository Structure (high level)**

- `app/` — Next.js app router routes and pages (web UI)
- `components/` — Reusable React components and UI patterns
- `lib/` — Core utilities, blockchain adapters, stores and helpers
- `mobile/` — Expo React Native mobile app and mobile-specific assets
- `public/` — Static assets served by the web app
- `e2e/` — End-to-end Playwright tests
- `components/__tests__/` and `lib/__tests__/` — Unit tests

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for contribution guidelines and PR expectations.

Getting started

1. Install dependencies (root):

```bash
pnpm install
```

2. Run the web app (development):

```bash
pnpm dev
```

3. Mobile app (from `mobile/`):

```bash
cd mobile
pnpm install
expo start
```

4. Tests:

```bash
pnpm test        # run unit tests (vitest)
pnpm run e2e     # run end-to-end tests (Playwright)
```

Notes and environment

- The project prefers `pnpm`; a `pnpm-lock.yaml` is included.
- Wallet integrations and local Stellar/testnet configuration are required for on-chain flows — see `lib/walletAdapter.ts` and `lib/stellarErrors.ts` for helpers and known errors.

**Roadmap & Where This Project Is Going**

- Improve Soroban smart-contract parity: finalize and audit core reward contracts.
- Robust on-chain UX: gasless flows, better error handling, and clearer signing prompts.
- Persistent IPFS pinning + CDN fallback for hosted assets to improve availability.
- Mobile parity: feature matching between web and mobile with offline play support.
- Better creator tooling: templates, analytics, and easy minting flows for rewards.
- Community features: in-app messaging, team hunts, and governance for shared hunts.
- Monetization & ops: gated paid hunts, sponsorships, and tooling for creators to monetize content.

# Hunty - Decentralized Scavenger Hunt Game

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)
[![Rust](https://img.shields.io/badge/rust-1.70+-orange.svg)](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
[![Soroban](https://img.shields.io/badge/soroban-22.0+-purple.svg)](https://soroban.stellar.org/)

Hunty is a decentralized scavenger hunt game built on Stellar/Soroban. Create thrilling scavenger hunts with multiple clues and challenges, engage players in immersive treasure hunts, and reward them with XLM tokens or exclusive NFTs.

## What is Hunty?

Imagine a treasure hunt where every clue is verified on the blockchain, every answer is secure, and every completion is rewarded with real value. That's Hunty.

Hunty transforms the classic scavenger hunt into a decentralized gaming experience. Hunt creators design custom challenges with multiple clues, each leading players closer to completion. Players race to solve clues, with their progress tracked transparently on-chain. When they complete all clues, they're rewarded with XLM tokens or unique NFTs that commemorate their achievement.

The beauty of Hunty lies in its simplicity and security. Answers are hashed on-chain, so no one can cheat by looking at the contract. Multiple hunts can run simultaneously, and players can participate in as many as they want. The entire system is trustless, transparent, and built on Stellar's fast, low-cost blockchain.

## Game Overview

### The Big Picture

Hunty operates as a three-contract system where each contract has a specific role:

1. **HuntyCore** - The game master that manages hunts, verifies answers, and tracks progress
2. **RewardManager** - The treasurer that coordinates and distributes rewards
3. **NftReward** - The mint that creates unique NFT trophies for completing players

Here's how they work together:

```mermaid
graph TB
    Creator[Hunt Creator] -->|Creates Hunt| HuntyCore[HuntyCore Contract]
    Creator -->|Adds Clues| HuntyCore
    Creator -->|Activates Hunt| HuntyCore

    style RewardManager fill:#50c878
    style NftReward fill:#ff6b6b
```

### How It Works

#### Creating a Hunt

Anyone can become a hunt creator. Here's what happens when you create a hunt:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Creator
    participant HuntyCore
    participant Storage
    
    Creator->>HuntyCore: create_hunt(title, description)
    HuntyCore->>HuntyCore: Generate unique hunt ID
    HuntyCore->>HuntyCore: Initialize hunt (status: Draft)
    HuntyCore->>Storage: Store hunt data
    HuntyCore->>Creator: Return hunt ID
    
    Creator->>HuntyCore: add_clue(hunt_id, question, answer)
    HuntyCore->>HuntyCore: Hash answer (SHA256)
    HuntyCore->>Storage: Store clue with hashed answer
    HuntyCore->>Creator: Clue added
    
    Note over Creator,HuntyCore: Repeat for all clues
    
    Creator->>HuntyCore: activate_hunt(hunt_id)
    HuntyCore->>HuntyCore: Validate hunt has clues
    HuntyCore->>Storage: Update status to Active
    HuntyCore->>Creator: Hunt activated!
```

**Key Points:**
- Hunts start in "Draft" status, so you can add clues before going live
- Answers are hashed using SHA256 before storage - this keeps them secret until someone solves them
- Only the creator can add clues and activate the hunt
- Once active, players can register and start playing

#### Playing a Hunt

The player experience is straightforward but exciting:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Player
    participant HuntyCore
    participant Storage
    
    Player->>HuntyCore: register_player(hunt_id)
    HuntyCore->>HuntyCore: Check hunt is Active
    HuntyCore->>Storage: Initialize player progress
    HuntyCore->>Player: Registration successful!
    
    Note over Player,HuntyCore: Player solves clues...
    
    Player->>HuntyCore: submit_answer(hunt_id, clue_id, answer)
    HuntyCore->>HuntyCore: Hash submitted answer
    HuntyCore->>Storage: Get stored answer hash
    HuntyCore->>HuntyCore: Compare hashes
    
    alt Answer is correct
        HuntyCore->>Storage: Update progress (add clue, update score)
        HuntyCore->>Player: Correct! Clue completed
    else Answer is incorrect
        HuntyCore->>Player: Incorrect answer
    end
    
    Note over Player,HuntyCore: Player completes all required clues...
    
    Player->>HuntyCore: complete_hunt(hunt_id)
    HuntyCore->>HuntyCore: Verify all clues completed
    HuntyCore->>Storage: Mark hunt as completed for player
    HuntyCore->>Player: Hunt completed! Rewards processing...
```

**Key Points:**
- Players can register for any active hunt
- Answers are verified on-chain by comparing hashes
- Progress is tracked transparently - you can see which clues you've completed
- Case-insensitive matching means "Paris" and "paris" both work
- Once all required clues are solved, the hunt is marked complete

#### Reward Distribution

This is where it gets exciting - players get rewarded for their efforts:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Player
    participant HuntyCore
    participant RewardManager
    participant XlmHandler
    participant NftHandler
    participant NftReward
    
    Player->>HuntyCore: complete_hunt(hunt_id)
    HuntyCore->>HuntyCore: Verify completion
    HuntyCore->>RewardManager: distribute_rewards(hunt_id, player, config)
    
    RewardManager->>RewardManager: Determine reward type
    
    alt XLM Rewards
        RewardManager->>XlmHandler: distribute_xlm(player, amount)
        XlmHandler->>XlmHandler: Validate reward pool
        XlmHandler->>Player: Transfer XLM
        XlmHandler->>RewardManager: Distribution complete
    end
    
    alt NFT Rewards
        RewardManager->>NftHandler: distribute_nft(player, metadata)
        NftHandler->>NftReward: mint_reward_nft(hunt_id, player, metadata)
        NftReward->>NftReward: Generate unique NFT ID
        NftReward->>NftReward: Store NFT metadata
        NftReward->>NftHandler: NFT minted
        NftHandler->>NftReward: transfer_nft(nft_id, player)
        NftReward->>Player: NFT transferred
        NftHandler->>RewardManager: Distribution complete
    end
    
    RewardManager->>Player: All rewards distributed!
```

**Key Points:**
- Rewards can be XLM tokens, NFTs, or both
- XLM is transferred directly to the player's wallet
- NFTs are minted on-demand and include hunt completion details
- Each NFT is unique and serves as a collectible trophy
- The entire process is automated and trustless
